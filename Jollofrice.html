    <h2>Steps to Jollof Rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. <br>This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; <br>I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout</li>
        <li>Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. <br>I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, <br>and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, <br>I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
        <li>Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. <br>If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam <br>in order to turn out well.</li>
        <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to <br>cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
