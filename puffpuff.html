    <h2>Steps to Prepare Puff Puff</h2>
   
    <ol>
        <li><P><strong>Proof the yeast:</strong>Both instant yeast or active yeast will work perfectly for this recipe. <br> If you are using instant yeast, you can skip proofing the yeast. If using active yeast, it’s advisable to proof the yeast.</P></li>
        <li><P><strong>Make the batter:</strong>Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients and mix well</P></li>
        <li><P><strong>Leave to proof:</strong>The batter needs to proof in a warm place for about an hour. <br> A little more or less or till the batter rises about twice or thrice its original size.</P></li>
        <li><P><strong>Fry:</strong>Be sure to let your oil get hot before frying the puff puff. If the oil is not <br>hot enough, the resulting puff puff will soak up the oil. You don’t want that.</P></li>
